A ticket can be created with a XSS payload in the subject field. This attack appears to be exploitable via <svg/onload=alert(1)> as the payload user on the Subject field. This makes it possible to obtain the cookies of all users that have permission to view the tickets. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.11.x after commit 33e2692a37b5b6340cf5bec1a84e541460983c03."
