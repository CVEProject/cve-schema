User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the WebAssembly.Instance method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-7466."
