Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.2.3.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Identity Manager. While the vulnerability is in Oracle Identity Manager, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Identity Manager accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Identity Manager.
