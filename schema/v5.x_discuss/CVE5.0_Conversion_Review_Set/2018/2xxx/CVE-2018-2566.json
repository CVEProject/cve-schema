Supported versions that are affected are 3.x and 4.x. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via TLS to compromise Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM). Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM), attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM) accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM) accessible data.
