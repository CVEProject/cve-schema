The SSL/TLS server certificate in the device to cloud communication was not verified by the device. As a result, an attacker in control of the network traffic of a device could have taken control of a device by intercepting and modifying commands issued from the server to the device in a Man-in-the-Middle attack. This included the ability to inject firmware update commands into the communication and cause the device to install maliciously modified firmware."
