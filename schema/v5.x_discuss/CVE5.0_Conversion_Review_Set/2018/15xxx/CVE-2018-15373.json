The vulnerability is due to improper memory handling by the affected software when the software processes high rates of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets that are sent to a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust memory on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition."
