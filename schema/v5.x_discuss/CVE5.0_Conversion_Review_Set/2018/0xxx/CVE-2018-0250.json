                "value": "A vulnerability in Central Web Authentication (CWA) with FlexConnect Access Points (APs) for Cisco Aironet 1560, 1810, 1810w, 1815, 1830, 1850, 2800, and 3800 Series APs could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass a configured FlexConnect access control list (ACL). The vulnerability is due to the AP ignoring the ACL download from the client during authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the targeted device with a vulnerable configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured client FlexConnect ACL. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Central Web Authentication with FlexConnect Access Points Software: Aironet 1560 Series Access Points, Aironet 1810 Series OfficeExtend Access Points, Aironet 1810w Series Access Points, Aironet 1815 Series Access Points, Aironet 1830 Series Access Points, Aironet 1850 Series Access Points, Aironet 2800 Series Access Points, Aironet 3800 Series Access Points. Note: Central Web Authentication with FlexConnect Access Points was an unsupported configuration until 8.5.100.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve17756."
