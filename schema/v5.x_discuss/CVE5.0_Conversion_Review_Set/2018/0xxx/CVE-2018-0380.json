                "value": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious .arf or .wrf file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file in the Webex recording players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The Cisco Webex players are applications that are used to play back Webex meetings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording that is hosted on a Webex server. The Webex Player for .wrf files can be downloaded manually. These vulnerabilities affect ARF and WRF recording players available from Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server.
