    "description": "disputed: When one party disagrees with another party's assertion that a particular issue in software is a vulnerability, a CVE Record assigned to that issue may be tagged as being 'disputed'.\n\nhardware-root-cause: Tag this to a CVE if the primary root cause of the security vulnerability originated from the hardware component of the affected product(s). The intent is to facilitate Hardware Designers to learn how to prevent similar weaknesses. Even when a hardware vulnerability can be addressed by a software workaround, the hardware-root-cause tag should still be applied, since the focus is on how the issue is introduced, not how it is remediated.\n\nsoftware-root-cause: Tag this to a CVE if the primary root cause of the security vulnerability originated from the software component of the affected product(s). The intent is to facilitate Software Developers to learn how to prevent similar weaknesses.\n\nspecification-root-cause: Tag this to a CVE if the primary root cause of the security vulnerability originated from the industry specification that the affected product(s) comply with. The intent is to facilitate Industry Specification Groups to learn how to prevent similar weaknesses. If the root cause of the CVE is related to inappropriate adoption of an industry standard (e.g., use of an obsolete cryptographic algorithm) or incorrect implementation of an industry standard (e.g., product does not implement the error recovery flow as captured in the protocol specification) in the affected product(s), the appropriate “Hardware Root Cause” or “Software Root Cause” should be applied instead.",
