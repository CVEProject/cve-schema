# Current Version of CVE Record Format

Major changes to cve-schema repo architecture!! if you have integrations that rely on the cve-schema repo structure, please review the changes here. The latest version of the CVE JSON record format is 5.1.0. A single schema file with bundled dependencies is available [here](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/docs/CVE_Record_Format_bundled.json).

Note: The CVE Record Format now supports Authorized Data Publisher (ADP) containers there is one active ADP currently.  The CVE Program uses a separate ADP container to provide additional CVE information (e.g., references) for some records. Access this README.md page [here](
https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/blob/main/README.md)
for more information about the CVE Program Container.

Note: Please refer to the CVE Services page [here](https://www.cve.org/AllResources/CveServices) for known issues with the schema. 

# CVE Record Format Overview

cve-schema specifies the CVE record format. This is the blueprint for a rich set of JSON data that can be submitted by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) and Authorized Data Publishers (ADPs) to describe a CVE record. Some examples of CVE record data include CVE ID number, affected product(s), affected version(s), and public references. While those specific items are required when assigning a CVE, there are many other optional data in the schema that can be used to enrich CVE records for community benefit.

This CVE record format is defined using JSON Schema. Learn more about JSON Schema at: [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/).

### Latest

The latest version of the record format is 5.1.0. It is specified in the [CVE Record Format JSON schema](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/CVE_Record_Format.json)

A single schema file with bundled schema dependencies can always be found [here](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/docs/CVE_Record_Format_bundled.json)

### Documentation and Guidance

Additional [Documentation](https://cveproject.github.io/cve-schema/schema/docs/) about the format is also available.

The CVE record structure is also viewable as an interactive [mindmap](https://cveproject.github.io/cve-schema/schema/docs/mindmap.html).

More details about Product and Product Version Formats/Encodings in CVE JSON 5.1.0 record can be found [here](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/docs/versions.md)
