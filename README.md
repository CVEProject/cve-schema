# cve-schema

cve-schema specifies the CVE JSON record format. This is the blueprint for a rich set of JSON data that can be submitted by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) and Authorized Data Publishers (ADPs) to describe a CVE record. Some examples of CVE record data include CVE ID number, affected product(s), affected version(s), and public references. While those specific items are required when assigning a CVE, there are many other optional data in the schema that can be used to enrich CVE records for community benefit.

This CVE JSON record format is defined using JSON Schema. Learn more about JSON Schema [here](https://json-schema.org/)

The latest version of the record format is 5.0. It is specified in the JSON schema at [CVE_JSON_5.0_schema.json](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/CVE_JSON_5.0_schema.json)

A single schema file with bundled dependencies is at [CVE_JSON_5.0_bundled.json](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/docs/CVE_JSON_5.0_bundled.json)

Documentation about this format is available in [docs](https://cveproject.github.io/cve-schema/schema/v5.0/docs/)

A mindmap version of the CVE record structure is at [mindmap](https://cveproject.github.io/cve-schema/schema/v5.0/docs/mindmap.html)

A basic example of a full record in 5.0 format with minimally required fields is available at [full-record-basic-example.json](https://github.com/cveproject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/docs/full-record-basic-example.json)

An advanced example of a full record in 5.0 format is available at [full-record-advanced-example.json](https://github.com/cveproject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/docs/full-record-advanced-example.json)

A basic example of a cnaContainer, to be used with CVE Services, is available at [cnaContainer-basic-example.json](https://github.com/cveproject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/docs/cnaContainer-basic-example.json)

An advanced example of a cnaContainer, to be used with CVE Services, is available at [cnaContainer-advanced-example.json](https://github.com/cveproject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/docs/cnaContainer-advanced-example.json)
