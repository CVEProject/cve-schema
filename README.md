# cve-schema

cve-schema specifies the CVE JSON record format. This is the blueprint for a rich set of JSON data that can be submitted by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) and Authorized Data Publishers (ADPs) to describe a CVE record. Some examples of CVE record data include CVE ID number, affected product(s), affected version(s), and public references. While those specific items are required when assigning a CVE, there are many other optional data in the schema that can be used to enrich CVE records for community benefit.
